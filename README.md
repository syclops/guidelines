# Guidelines

Self-imposed guidelines for various tools and languages. These guidelines mostly
consist of style tips, but may occasionally include idiosyncratic features of a
language that should be used a certain way.

For the most part these guidelines refer to programming languages and tools, but
there will be sections for non-technical use cases as well, such as English
prose.
